## MANDATORY UnrealMCP Safety Rules

These rules exist because violating them CRASHES Unreal Engine. They are non-negotiable.

### Actor Deletion Rules
1. **NEVER use `World->DestroyActor()` or `Actor->Destroy()` in editor context.** Use `EditorActorSubsystem::DestroyActors()` instead - it handles editor notifications, scene outliner updates, and OFPA package cleanup.
2. **NEVER call `Actor->Rename()` on editor actors.** UE5.5+ OFPA (One File Per Actor) causes `UDeletedObjectPlaceholder` assertion crashes when renaming actors that have external packages.
3. **NEVER delete and spawn actors with the same name in the same tick.** `DestroyActor` marks pending-kill but the name stays registered in `FUObjectHashTables` until GC runs. Spawning with the same name causes "Cannot generate unique name" fatal crash.
4. **NEVER destroy actors during iteration.** Collect actors into a TArray first, then destroy from the array.

### Actor Spawning Rules
5. **ALWAYS use `ESpawnActorNameMode::Requested`** (not the default `Required_Fatal`). This gracefully generates a unique name if the requested name is taken, instead of crashing.
6. **NEVER reuse actor names.** Always append a unique suffix (timestamp, GUID, counter). Names are only freed after garbage collection, not after DestroyActor.
7. **ALWAYS check `IsValid(Actor)` before operating on any actor pointer.** `IsPendingKill()` is deprecated in UE5.

### Bulk Operation Rules
8. **NEVER perform more than 3 spawn/destroy operations in a single FTSTicker tick.** Each spawn/destroy triggers component registration, physics scene updates, and rendering cleanup. More than 3 per tick risks crashes and frame hitches.
9. **NEVER call MCP tools in parallel.** Each MCP tool creates its own FTSTicker callback. Multiple callbacks firing in the same frame can crash.
10. **Separate delete and spawn phases.** If replacing actors: Phase 1 = destroy all (spread across ticks), then Phase 2 = spawn new (spread across ticks). Never interleave.

### Viewport & Screenshot Rules
11. **NEVER call `FlushRenderingCommands()` in FTSTicker callbacks.** It blocks the game thread waiting for render thread, risking deadlocks. Let the engine handle rendering sync naturally.
12. **Use `FScreenshotRequest::RequestScreenshot()` for screenshots** instead of direct `Viewport->ReadPixels()`. The request API handles rendering synchronization internally.
13. **Use `GEditor->GetLevelViewportClients()` for viewport access**, not `GetAllViewportClients()` or `GetActiveViewport()` which may return non-level viewports (material editors, asset previews).

### Texture Import & Heavy Asset Rules
14. **NEVER import more than 2 textures without pausing.** Each `import_texture` call triggers `PostEditChange()` (texture recompression), `UpdateResource()` (GPU upload), and `AssetCreated()` (registry broadcast). Back-to-back imports create catastrophic memory pressure and notification storms that can crash the engine or corrupt landscape streaming proxies.
15. **Treat `import_texture` as a HEAVY operation** on par with `import_mesh`. Each import decompresses the source image (~64MB for a 4K texture), builds platform mip chains, and broadcasts to all editor subsystems synchronously.
16. **After every 2 texture imports, call a lightweight operation** (e.g., `get_actors_in_level`, `list_assets`, or `does_asset_exist`) to give the engine a full tick to process streaming updates, GC, and notification queues before importing more textures.
17. **NEVER import textures while landscape operations are pending.** Texture imports trigger AssetRegistry notifications that can cause World Partition to re-evaluate landscape streaming proxy loading, potentially unloading/corrupting landscape sections.
18. **`CreatePackage()` + `MarkPackageDirty()` without save accumulates in memory.** Each unsaved package stays in RAM until user saves. Multiple unsaved texture packages compete with landscape streaming proxies for memory budget.

### Material Creation Rules
19. **UE 5.7 has NO `bUsedWithLandscape` flag.** Landscape materials compile without special usage flags. Checkerboard on landscape = shader compilation error (check for ERROR nodes in the material graph).
20. **ALWAYS match vector dimensions in material expressions.** Texture samples output float4 (RGBA). UV coordinates are float2. Before combining them (Add, Multiply), use ComponentMask to match dimensions. `Add(float2, float4)` = ERROR node.
21. **ALWAYS verify shader compilation after creating/modifying materials.** Check for checkerboard in viewport or ERROR labels on nodes. A material with 32 expressions that compiles with errors is worse than a simple 3-node material that works.
22. **NEVER use LandscapeLayerCoords for UV generation** — `mapping_scale` does NOT persist through editor restart. Use `WorldPosition × Constant` instead (values always persist).
23. **NEVER use LandscapeLayerBlend** via MCP — causes `TextureReferenceIndex != INDEX_NONE` crash in HLSLMaterialTranslator.cpp.
24. **NEVER build more than 10 material nodes without recompiling and visually verifying.** Material graph errors are silent — MCP returns "success" even when connections are invalid. Verify early and often.

### Material Rules
25. **NEVER connect AmbientOcclusion from ARM textures.** ARM textures from Megascans/PolyHaven have AO=0 in UV padding areas, causing dark glossy patches on meshes. UE5 Lumen handles ambient occlusion automatically. The `create_pbr_material` tool intentionally does NOT connect AO.

### Anti-Tiling Rules
26. **NEVER use texture bombing for anti-tiling** (sampling same texture twice at fixed UV offsets and blending with noise). The noise frequency inevitably matches the tile frequency, so each noise blob covers exactly one tile — the grid is still visible. Use **UV noise distortion** instead: warp UV coordinates with continuous low-frequency noise BEFORE sampling, so every pixel gets a unique UV offset.
27. **UV distortion warp_scale must be ~80x smaller than detail_uv_scale.** If detail_uv_scale=0.004, warp_scale should be ~0.00005. If they're too close, the warp pattern itself becomes visible. If too far apart, the warp has no visible effect on the tile grid.
28. **Always use two separate noise nodes for X and Y UV warp.** Feed WarpNoiseY a position-offset version of WorldPos (e.g., WorldPos + Constant3Vector(1000,2000,0)) to get a different noise pattern. Using the same noise for both axes creates directional smearing.

### Binary vs Source Freshness (CRITICAL — CHECK FIRST)
29. **ALWAYS check if the compiled .so binary is newer than ALL source files BEFORE debugging runtime issues.** Linux UE5 does NOT hot-reload .so files. If the binary is older than any source file, the editor is running stale code. STOP investigating, rebuild the plugin, and restart the editor. Compare timestamps: `stat -c %Y Plugins/*/Binaries/Linux/*.so` vs source `.cpp`/`.h` files. This has wasted 4+ debugging sessions where fixes already existed in source but the running binary was outdated.

### General MCP Rules
30. **ALWAYS call MCP tools strictly sequentially.** Wait for one response before sending the next command.
31. **NEVER batch heavy operations in a single FTSTicker callback.** If an operation needs to process N items, use a recurring ticker that processes 3 items per tick.
32. **Test new C++ changes with a SINGLE lightweight operation first** before attempting bulk operations. Verify the fix works before scaling up.
33. **Heavy operations classification:** The following MCP commands are HEAVY and need extra caution: `import_texture`, `import_mesh`, `create_pbr_material`, `create_landscape_material`, `scatter_meshes_on_landscape`. Always allow a full engine tick between consecutive heavy operations.
34. **FTSTicker callbacks can stack.** If commands arrive faster than the game thread processes them, multiple ticker callbacks queue up and fire back-to-back in the same or consecutive frames with no breathing room for engine subsystems (streaming, GC, landscape component updates).
35. **`PostEditChange()` is a nuclear broadcast.** It triggers dozens of subsystem notifications synchronously (texture streaming, shader recompilation, asset registry updates). Calling it 6+ times in rapid succession overwhelms the editor's ability to maintain consistency.

### Skeletal Mesh & Animation Import Rules
36. **Skeletal mesh import is HEAVIER than static mesh.** It creates a USkeleton, UPhysicsAsset, processes skin weights and bone hierarchy. Allow 5+ seconds cooldown before the next heavy operation. Add `import_skeletal_mesh` to `HEAVY_COMMANDS_COOLDOWN` and `LARGE_OPERATION_COMMANDS`.
37. **Animation-only import REQUIRES an existing skeleton.** Always validate that `skeleton_path` resolves to a valid `USkeleton` before calling `import_animation`. Null skeleton = crash or silent failure.
38. **ACharacter CDO components are NOT in SimpleConstructionScript.** `UCapsuleComponent`, `USkeletalMeshComponent` (Mesh), and `UCharacterMovementComponent` are created in the C++ constructor. To modify their defaults in a Blueprint: compile the BP first, then access via `Blueprint->GeneratedClass->GetDefaultObject<ACharacter>()`. SpringArm and Camera must be added via SCS since they are not part of base ACharacter.
39. **`UAnimBlueprintFactory` CRASHES if `TargetSkeleton` is null** and `bTemplate` is false. Always validate the skeleton asset exists and loads successfully before calling `FactoryCreateNew()`.
40. **FBX files can produce multiple assets.** When importing skeletal mesh with `bImportAnimations=true`, iterate `ImportTask->GetObjects()` to find all created assets (SkeletalMesh + AnimSequence[]). Do not assume a single result.
41. **NEVER import skeletal mesh + animation in parallel MCP calls.** Always strictly sequential with breathing room between each. The skeleton created by mesh import must be fully saved before animation import references it.
